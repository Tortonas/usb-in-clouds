# USB in clouds

This is like your USB portable flash drive, but you can access it from any point in the world, all you have to do is have internet  connection. Functionality is similar to google drive or microsoft onedrive, but you can upload, download files only with 2 clicks. 1. Login by writing only password. 2. Upload or download button. This project was developed while learning PHP language. Website doesn't meet with modern standarts. This project is planned to be re-done from scratch with a team at Kaunas Technology University as "Semester Project" module. When final version will be released it will be up here - https://github.com/Tortonas/devbridge-project
